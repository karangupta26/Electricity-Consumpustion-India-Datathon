# Electricity-Consumpustion-India-Datathon

This Study Has been conducted by [Swati Arora](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swati-arora-59515213a/), [Vaishali singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaishali-singh-997s/) and [Karan Gupta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karangupta26/).They have conducted their study under the name of "DATA GEEKS" and are participation in Melbourne Datathon Challenge A.

### About 

Data Geeks have Analysed the Electricity Consumption in India(Norhtern Region). For that they have used the [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/state-wise-power-consumption-in-india) from here.

### Tools Used
- Data Wrangling

    For this the user must use Python from this [Site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).After Installtion with PIP, User have to Install Required Dependecies Using Code

      pip install -r requirements.txt
      
    After installation the user have to keep the PreProcessing.ipynb and log_data_.csv in same directory.Afer that the have to run jupyter Lab in CMD/Terminal
    
       jupyter lab
 
 - Data Analysis
     
     In this tool which is used is [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).
     
     Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and         interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses.
      1. Install Microsoft power Bi desktop in your pc. 
      2. After installation,  open the software . 
      3. A new file will appear where certain tools and visualization methods, filters, fields(columns of your dataset) will be given. 
      4. Next, click on get data where you will find various options of to upload data. Select csv dataset. 
      5. Now click on load the data.
      6. Various columns will appear now visualize the one on which you want to show comparisons or correlations from the field set by selecting the columns. 
      7. You will find visualuzation tool bar on the right where clustered charts, pie chart, tables, map, heat map, Q&A and many other visual tools are given. 
      8. To check the consumption of electricity plot various charts. 
      9. Save your file and later you can publish it, which anyone can see on their phones or desktop using Bi software n app.
